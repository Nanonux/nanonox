        <h1>Hey there!</h1>
          <p id="abt">Welcome to my official about me site, created by me! I made this site so that users like yourself might come on here looking for certain public info about me for whatever reason. Hope you like! :)<br><br>Here's all the main info you'll need to learn a lil' about me:<br>First of all, I'm a boy, duh, and like all boys, I like to play video games. I play a variety of games from shooting games to just regular mobile or competitive games. One of my favs, however, over all of these, is <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us">Minecraft.</a><br><br><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MmB9b5njVbA?si=0dJyiTVGkyZlhYP8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><br>
            Aside from gaming, I do have other hobbies such as coding, listening to music, playing sports, reading books, and hanging with friends. That's about it. If you have any inquiries, feel free to <a href="mailto:samplemail@gmail.com">email</a> me and be sure to check out my socials! :)
