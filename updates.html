    <h1>Site Updates</h1>
    <p id="p">Hi, this page is mainly just to see all my tracked progress I made whilst making this site. It helped me see where I was at while creating this and what I still needed to get done. I thought it deserved a place on my site, so here it is :D</p>

                <td>I added my brand logo to the site and made it so that the link to the 'Home' page is embedded in the image.</td>
